## The Problem

As a photographer or videographer, you've probably experienced these frustrations:

**🗂️ Inconsistent Organization**
- Every project starts with the same tedious folder creation process
- Different folder structures across projects make files hard to find
- Manual folder creation is error-prone and time-consuming

**👥 Client Management Chaos**
- Retyping client names and creating duplicate folder structures
- No easy way to see what clients you've worked with
- Inconsistent naming conventions across client projects

**🎥 Multi-Camera Complexity**
- Managing footage from multiple cameras becomes a nightmare
- No standardized way to organize main, BTS, drone, and interview footage
- Hours wasted manually creating and naming camera-specific folders

**📁 Repetitive Setup**
- The same folder structure setup for every single project
- No intelligence about your existing folder organization
- Starting from scratch in new locations recreates entire directory trees

## Why This Tool Exists

## Folder Structure

The CLI generates standardized folder structures based on industry best practices:

### Photo Projects
```
PHOTO/
├── Client Work/
│   └── [CLIENT-NAME]/
│       └── [YYYY-MM-DD-Project Name]/
│           ├── RAW/
│           ├── Edited/
│           ├── Deliverables/
│           ├── Contracts & Briefs/
│           ├── Exports for Social-Print/
│           └── Capture One/ (optional)
└── Personal Work/
    └── [YEAR]/
        └── [Project Name]/
            ├── RAW/
            ├── Edited/
            └── Exports for Social-Print/
```

### Video Projects
```
VIDEO/
├── Client Work/
│   └── [CLIENT-NAME]/
│       └── [YYYY-MM-DD-Project Name]/
│           ├── Footage/
│           │   ├── RAW/
│           │   └── Proxies/ (optional)
│           ├── Edited/
│           ├── Deliverables/
│           ├── Contracts & Briefs/
│           ├── Exports/
│           ├── Thumbnail & Graphics/
│           └── Audio/
└── Personal Work/
    └── [YEAR]/
        └── [Project Name]/
            ├── Footage/
            ├── Edited/
            ├── Exports/
            └── Audio/
```

## Smart Path Detection

The CLI automatically detects if you're already inside part of your folder structure and intelligently skips creating redundant folders:

### How It Works
- **Detects existing structure**: If you're in `PHOTO/Client Work/ABC Corp/`, it won't recreate those folders
- **Auto-suggests values**: Pre-fills project type, work type, and client name based on your current location
- **Discovers existing clients**: Automatically scans Client Work folders to find existing clients
- **Interactive confirmation**: In interactive mode, asks if you want to use smart detection
- **Command-line control**: Use `--no-smart-path` flag to disable for specific commands

### Automatic Client Discovery

When you're in or near Client Work directories, the CLI automatically discovers existing client folders and presents them as options:

#### What Gets Discovered
- **Scans Client Work folders**: Automatically finds all client folders in `PHOTO/Client Work/` and `VIDEO/Client Work/`
- **Merges with database**: Combines discovered clients with your saved client database
- **Visual indicators**: Shows the source of each client option

#### Client Selection Display
```
💡 Found 3 existing client folders: ABC Corp, XYZ Ltd, John Doe

Select a client:
  ✨ 📁📋 ABC Corp (current location)     # In both folders and database
  📁 XYZ Ltd (from folders)              # Found in filesystem only
  📁 John Doe (from folders)             # Found in filesystem only  
  📋 Previous Client                     # From database only
  ➕ Add New Client
```

#### Auto-Discovery Benefits
- **No retyping**: Never manually type client names that already exist as folders
- **Database sync**: Discovered clients are automatically added to your database for future use
- **Smart location detection**: Highlights your current client folder location
- **Works anywhere**: Discovers clients even when you're in Personal Work or project subfolders

### Examples

```bash
# You're in: /Projects/PHOTO/Client Work/ABC Corp/
# CLI detects: Photo project, Client work, ABC Corp client
# Creates: 2024-01-15-New Project/ (directly here, no duplicate folders)

# You're in: /Projects/PHOTO/Personal Work/2024/
# CLI detects: Photo project, Personal work, 2024 year
# Creates: New Project/ (directly here)

# You're in: /Projects/PHOTO/Client Work/
# CLI detects: Photo project, Client work
# Discovers: ABC Corp, XYZ Ltd, John Doe (from existing folders)
# Presents: All discovered clients as selectable options

# You're in: /Projects/
# CLI detects: Nothing special
# Creates: PHOTO/Client Work/ABC Corp/2024-01-15-New Project/
```

## Configuration

The CLI creates a configuration file at `~/.sbp-generator/config.json` on first run. You can customize folder names and settings to match your existing structure.

### View Current Configuration
```bash
structure-cli config
```

### Common Configuration Changes

**Change Folder Names** (e.g., if you use "VIDEO" instead of "Videography"):
```bash
# Edit ~/.sbp-generator/config.json
{
  "base_directories": {
    "photography": "PHOTO",        // Your photo folder name
    "videography": "VIDEO",        // Your video folder name  
    "assets": "Assets & Resources"
  }
}
```

**Customize Subfolders**:
```bash
{
  "client_work_subfolder": "Client Work",     // or "Clients"
  "personal_work_subfolder": "Personal Work"  // or "Personal"
}
```

**Reset to Defaults**:
```bash
structure-cli reset-config
```

### Configuration File Location
- **File**: `~/.sbp-generator/config.json`
- **Note**: This file is automatically created and should be in your `.gitignore`

## Multi-Camera Support

For video projects, organize your footage by camera and purpose with intelligent folder naming:

### How It Works
- **Purpose-based organization**: `main`, `BTS`, `secondary`, `drone`, `interview`, `detail`, `backup`
- **Camera-specific folders**: Automatically creates `purpose-camera` folder structure
- **Applies to RAW and Proxies**: Camera folders created in both `Footage/RAW/` and `Footage/Proxies/` (if enabled)

### Setup Options

**Interactive Mode** (Recommended)
```bash
structure-cli interactive
# Follow prompts to set up cameras step-by-step
```

**Command Line**
```bash
# Single camera setup
--cameras "main:camera1"

# Multi-camera setup
--cameras "main:camera1,BTS:camera2,drone:camera3"

# Complex setup
--cameras "main:camera1,secondary:camera2,interview:camera3,BTS:camera4"
```
